# Intel Arc GPU Setup for Distributed Training

## Your System
- **GPU**: Intel Arc 140T (15GB)
- **Current Setup**: NVIDIA containers (needs changes)

## Problem
Your Docker containers are configured for NVIDIA GPUs, but you have an Intel Arc GPU. Intel Arc GPUs are supported by PyTorch but need different drivers and setup.

## Solutions

### ✅ **Option 1: Use Native Python (Easiest)**

Install Intel PyTorch extension and run without Docker:

```powershell
# Install Intel PyTorch (has Intel GPU support)
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Or use Intel Extension for PyTorch
pip install intel-extension-for-pytorch

# Run training
python slurm_training_demo.py --config config.json
```

### ✅ **Option 2: Modify Docker Setup for Intel Arc**

Create a new Dockerfile for Intel Arc:

```dockerfile
FROM intel/intel-optimized-pytorch:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
```

### ⚠️ **Option 3: Use CPU (Current Working Setup)**

Your current setup already works! It's running distributed training on 4 containers using CPU.

## Current Status

Your distributed training is **ALREADY RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY** with CPU across 4 containers:
- ✓ All 4 workers connected
- ✓ Distributed training initialized
- ✓ CIFAR-10 dataset loaded
- ✓ Training in progress

## Recommendation

**For Intel Arc GPU:**
1. Use native Python with Intel PyTorch extensions
2. Or continue with current CPU-based distributed setup (which is working well!)

**To use Intel Arc GPU with PyTorch:**
```powershell
# Install Intel-optimized PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Verify GPU detection
python -c "import torch; print(f'Intel GPU available: {torch.version.ipex is not None}')"
```

The Intel Arc GPU will work with oneAPI/PyTorch but needs specific drivers and extensions installed.
