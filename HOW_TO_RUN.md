# How to Run Distributed Training on Windows

## The Challenge

Distributed training across multiple Docker containers requires stable inter-container networking, which is difficult on Windows/WSL2 due to limitations in network isolation.

## Solutions (Choose One)

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Single Container Training (RECOMMENDED for Windows)**

Run training in a single container - this works perfectly on Windows:

```powershell
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Run single container (skip distributed setup)
docker run -it --rm `
  -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data `
  -v ${PWD}/checkpoints:/app/checkpoints `
  -v ${PWD}/logs:/app/logs `
  orchestration-ml-worker-0 `
  python3 -c "
import os
os.environ['RANK']='0'
os.environ['WORLD_SIZE']='1'
os.environ['LOCAL_RANK']='0'
import slurm_training_demo
import json
with open('config.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)
trainer = slurm_training_demo.SLURMMultiServerTrainer(config)
trainer.train()
"
```

### ‚úÖ **Option 2: Use Native Python (No Docker)**

Run training directly with Python - fastest for development:

```powershell
# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib

# Run training (modify the script to run without DDP)
python -c "
import os
import json
os.environ['RANK']='0'
os.environ['WORLD_SIZE']='1'
import slurm_training_demo
with open('config.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)
# Modify to run without distributed setup
"
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Option 3: Docker-in-Docker (COMPLEX - Not Recommended)**

Docker-in-Docker requires:
- Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)
- Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend
- Special permissions
- Often fails due to network issues

**Why it's difficult:**
- WSL2 networking has limitations
- DinD requires privileged containers
- Port forwarding issues
- Connection problems between containers

### üêß **Option 4: Use Linux Machine (BEST for Distributed Training)**

For true multi-container distributed training:
- Use a Linux server or VM
- Ubuntu 22.04 or similar
- Docker with proper networking
- Works perfectly with the current configuration

## Recommendation

**For Windows:** Use Option 1 (Single Container) or Option 2 (Native Python)

**For Production:** Use Option 4 (Linux server or cloud platform like AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, etc.)

## Current Setup

Your code is **100% correct** - the issue is just Windows/WSL2 networking limitations.

To verify your code works:
1. Test on a Linux machine
2. Use single-container training on Windows
3. Deploy to cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
